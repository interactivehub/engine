# Roulette Game

## Overview

The `roulette` package in Go implements a simple roulette game, where players can join rounds, place bets, and roll the wheel to determine the winning slot. The game incorporates a provably fair mechanism to ensure fairness and randomness in determining the outcomes.

## Provably Fair Mechanism

The provably fair mechanism is based on using a combination of client seed and server seed to generate a random number for determining the winning slot. The server seed is blinded using SHA-256, and the HMAC-SHA512 algorithm is utilized for calculating a secure random number. The calculated random number is then used to determine the winning slot.

### Components

- **Client Seed**: Provided by the client, serving as an additional input to the random number generation process.
- **Server Seed**: Generated by the server. Used to calculate the HMAC.
- **Blinded Server Seed**: SHA-256 hash of the server seed.
- **Nonce**: A counter that increases with each roll to ensure uniqueness and prevent repetition.

### Workflow

1. **Initialization**: Create a new provably fair instance with the client seed and server seed. If no server seed is provided, a random one is generated.
2. **Calculation**: Calculate a random number using HMAC-SHA512 and the provided seeds, considering a range from 0 to 999999.
3. **Determining the Winning Slot**: Use the random number to determine the winning slot.

## Roulette Game Components

### `provablyFair` Struct

- Represents the provably fair mechanism used in the game.

### `RouletteRound` Struct

- Represents a round of roulette, incorporating the provably fair mechanism, round ID, entries, outcome, and round timing.

### `RouletteRoundEntry` Struct

- Represents an entry made by a player in a roulette round, including user ID, wager, and pick (color).

### `RouletteSlot` Struct

- Represents a roulette slot, containing an index, color, and payout multiplier.

## Usage

- `NewRouletteRound`: Create a new roulette round.
- `Join`: Allow players to join the round by placing bets.
- `Roll`: Simulate a roll to determine the winning slot.

## Verification

- `Verify`: Allow for the verification of the round's outcome using client seed, server seed, nonce, and the provided random number.

## Roulette Slots

- The roulette wheel consists of 15 slots, each with a specific color and payout multiplier.

## Error Handling

- Proper error handling is in place to address various scenarios, ensuring the integrity of the game's logic.

## Future Improvements

- Persistence of round data in a database for future tracking and analysis.
